The main idea of this project is to create a serializable class library that can accommodate all notations in XPDL 2.1 file.

This project contains 2 different parts:

BPMVE\_XPDL\_Library project contains all data structures (classes and attributes) needed to accommodate a XPDL 2.1 diagram.

BPMVE\_XPDL\_Library\_UnitTest contains all unit testings, currently there are 233 test cases that test the serialization and deserialization equality of BPMVE\_XPDL\_Library.

API folder contains a zipped version of the documentation generated using Doxygen. A compiled .CHM version will be included in the future release.

Class Diagrams folder contains all class diagrams generated with Visual Studio IDE.

This project uses .NET Framework 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008 or MonoDevelop 2.2 IDE.
